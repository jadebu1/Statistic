### Problem 1
``` {r count and find means}
ICE <- read_csv("IceCream.csv")
#alpha = 0.1 df=200-1=199
ICE %>% glimpse
ICE %>% count(Puzzle)
mean(ICE$Puzzle) 
sd(ICE$Puzzle)
qt(0.05,199)
tsum.test(mean(ICE$Puzzle), sd(ICE$Puzzle), 200, conf.level = 0.90)$conf.int

```
```{r difference in mean puzzle scores}
Male <- ICE %>% filter(Sex == "0")
Female <- ICE %>% filter(Sex == "1")
SDM <- sd(Male$Puzzle) - mean(Female$Puzzle)
SDM
DFM <- mean(Male$Puzzle) - mean(Female$Puzzle)
DFM
tsum.test(DFM, SDM, 200, conf.level = 0.90)$conf.int
